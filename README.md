# 🌟 Apello Frontend  
### Secure, Signature-Free Web3 Community Verification

Welcome to the **Apello Frontend** — the user-facing interface of Apello, the all-in-one community management toolkit for creators, NFT projects, DAOs, and web3 communities.

🔗 **Live website:** https://apello.xyz

This repository contains the **frontend code only** — no backend logic, no server-side secrets, and absolutely **no interactions that ever ask for private keys, wallet phrases, signatures, or sensitive data**.

Apello is built with user safety and trustlessness at its core.

## ✨ What Is Apello?

Apello is a frictionless web3 verification and role-management platform designed to connect **on-chain ownership** with **social access** — without requiring users to perform signatures, pay fees, or trust centralized systems.

We empower communities by automating:

- NFT holder verification  
- Role assignment  
- Access control for gated channels  
- Cross-platform identity linking (Discord, Telegram, X, etc.)  
- Multi-chain ownership validation  

All of this happens **securely and trustlessly**, using only public on-chain data.

## 🔐 No Signatures. No Private Keys. No Risks.

To make things absolutely clear for anyone reviewing this repository:

### ❌ We never request wallet keys  
### ❌ We never ask for seed phrases  
### ❌ We never require message signing  
### ❌ We never ask for transaction approval  
### ❌ We never store private data locally or on servers  

### ✔ Users only connect their wallet to read *public ownership data*  
### ✔ Verification on Apello is 100% signature-free  
### ✔ Frontend remains fully open-source for transparency  

Your wallet stays yours — always.
